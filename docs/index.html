                Food poisoning, also called foodborne illness, is an infection or irritation of your digestive tract that spreads through food or drinks. 
                Viruses, bacteria, and parasites cause most food poisoning. 
                Harmful chemicals may also be a contributor (<a href = "https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/food-poisoning/definition-facts"> <i> source: NIH </i></a>).
                Food poisoning was first identified as a public health issue in the 1880s.

              When two or more people get the same illness from the same contaminated food or drink, the event is called a foodborne outbreak. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention began tracking these outbreaks in the 1970s.

              Chicago is home to more than 20,000 food establishments like restaurants, grocery stores, bakeries, and more. In order to prevent the spread of food-borne disease, inspections are periodically performed by a team from the Chicago Department of Public Health’s Food Protection Program (<a href = "https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/ofinterest/bus/food.html)" style="color:white"><i>Source: Chicago Goverment</i></a>).
              </p>
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>2 main types of inspections were considered: Routine Health Inspections (canvas) and Complaint- Based Health Inspections (complaints and inspections due to food poisoning).</li>
                <li>The frequency of these inspections is based on the risk level assigned to the establishment. This risk depends on the types of food prepared and the methods used for preparing and serving the food. In general, risk 1 establishments are inspected twice per year, risk 2 establishments once per year, and risk 3 establishments every other year.</li>
                <li>An inspection can pass, pass with conditions or fail (<a href = "https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/cdph/provdrs/healthy_restaurants/svcs/understand_healthcoderequirementsforfoodestablishments.html" style = "color:white"><i>source: Chicago Government</i></a>).

              Between 1940 and 1960, the amount of mail doubled in The United States . In 1963, the Zone Improvement Plan divided the country into ten regions and assigned 5 digits increasing in specificity, from region to large sorting centers. 
              The two first digits associated with city of Chicago zip code are 60. The 3 last are specifics to post office or delivery area. For data analysis purpose, ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) are often used instead of postal zip codes. These are approximate area representations of U.S. Postal Service (USPS) ZIP Code service areas that the Census Bureau creates to present statistical data from Census.
              </p>
            <p>
              ZIP codes division can be helpful for visualizing spatial inequalities in Chicago. 
              As each zip code have a different number of facilities, one need to remove this bias. To do so, we will normalize the facilities count as follows: 
              definition of proportion: #facilities with feature (i) per zip code / #total facilities per zip code.
              <br>An example of this is shown below with the fail proportion of the facilites per zip code for the food inspections.

                  Also, almost none of them are associated with a low risk level which shows the consistency of this risk scale.
                  <br>
                  Although the plot show that over 80% of the facilities that are suspected for food poisoning have a high risk level, we can not conclude that a facility with a high risk level will cause food poisoning.

                Curiously, even if the area associated with the zip code 60827 (marked in the plot) have the lowest proportion of high risk facilities, a high number of inspections due to food poisoning can be observed.
                The 60827 zip code is associated with a community called Riverdale. Riverdale is one of the hardest neighborhoods in the city and considered one of the most dangerous communities.
                It is known to struggle with high unemployment, poverty and gang violence.
                </p>
              <p>
                The Chicago Community Area of Riverdale includes Altgeld Gardens, a public housing development once dubbed Chicago's "toxic doughnut"  due to having the highest concentration of hazardous waste sites in the nation (<a href = "https://ejatlas.org/conflict/chicagos-toxic-doughnut-usa"><i>source</i></a>).
                This factor contributed to health burdens in the community through water contamination and air pollution. 
                Thus, the high number of inspection due to food poisoning reported in this area could be explained by the fact that this factor contributed to health burdens in the community through water contamination. 
                In fact, water contamination leads to a poor cleanliness (contaminated cooking tools, food..) which may increase the poisoning cases even though the facility have safe food preparation habits. 
                Thus, Riverdale could be considered as an outlier.
                After removing this outlier, a Spearman's correlation was run to determine the relationship between the proportion of facilities associated with a high risk level and the proportion of inspection due to food poisoning. 
                There was a weak, positive monotonic correlation between these two parameters reflectexted by a significant coefficient equal to 0.4 (n = 51, p < 0.05).
                </p>
              <p>
                Each violation have a number which refers to a particular category of violations. The Chicago Food Reporting Inspection System distinguish between 3 type of violations. 
                <ul>
                <li>From 1 to 14 : Priority (P) Violations, which are critical can create an immediate health hazard that carries a greater risk of causing food-borne illness. The facility needs to correct immediately this kind of violation during the inspection otherwise the license business is suspended.</li> 
                <li>From 15 to 29 : Priority Foundation (FP) Violation, which are serious can create a potential health hazard. If not immediately corrected , the inspection fails.</li>
                <li>From 30 to 44 + 70 : Core Violation (C), which are minor do not pose an immediate threat to the public’s health.</li>
                </ul>
                
                The inspections that were made due to suspected poisoning shows a higher frequency of priority and priority foundation violations.

              <span style="color:rgb(63, 126, 155)"><b>Escherichia coli</b></span> is a bacterium that lives in the intestines of humans and animals alike and also causes food poisoning illness. A major source of E. coli infections is undercooked beef. Other sources of E. coli bacteria include <span style="color: rgb(63, 126, 155)"><b>drinking or swimming in water that is contaminated by sewage. 
              E. coli bacterium</b></span>, which is present in stool, can be passed from person-to-person as a result of improper hygiene or handwashing practices.
              People can become infected when a contaminated city or town water supply has not been properly treated with chlorine or when people accidentally swallow contaminated water while swimming in a lake, beach, or irrigation canal.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Chicago Park District issued swim advisories at beaches along Chicago's Lake Michigan lakefront based on E. coli levels. The US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) recommends notifying the public when E. coli bacteria levels are above the federal water quality Beach Action Value (BAV), which is 235*CFU.
              Using <a href= "https://www.kaggle.com/chicago/chicago-beach-swim,-weather,-lab-data" style="color:white"><u>data</u></a> showing predicted E. coli levels in Chicago beaches water based on an experimental analytical modeling approach, we can try to detect if some beaches are 
              particularly contaminated.
