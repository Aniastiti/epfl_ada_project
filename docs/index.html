                Food poisoning, also called foodborne illness, is an infection or irritation of your digestive tract that spreads through food or drinks. 
                Viruses, bacteria, and parasites cause most food poisoning. 
                Harmful chemicals may also be a contributor (<a href = "https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/food-poisoning/definition-facts"> <i> source: NIH </i></a>).
                Food poisoning was first identified as a public health issue in the 1880s.

              Chicago is home to more than 20,000 food establishments like restaurants, grocery stores, bakeries, and more. In order to prevent the spread of food-borne disease, inspections are periodically performed by a team from the Chicago Department of Public Health’s Food Protection Program (<a href = "https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/ofinterest/bus/food.html)" style="color:white"><i>Source: Chicago Goverment</i></a>).
              </p>
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>2 main types of inspections were considered: Routine Health Inspections (canvas) and Complaint- Based Health Inspections (complaints and inspections due to food poisoning).</li>
                <li>The frequency of these inspections is based on the risk level assigned to the establishment. This risk depends on the types of food prepared and the methods used for preparing and serving the food. In general, risk 1 establishments are inspected twice per year, risk 2 establishments once per year, and risk 3 establishments every other year.</li>
                <li>An inspection can pass, pass with conditions or fail (<a href = "https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/cdph/provdrs/healthy_restaurants/svcs/understand_healthcoderequirementsforfoodestablishments.html" style = "color:white"><i>source: Chicago Government</i></a>).

              Between 1940 and 1960, the amount of mail doubled in The United States . In 1963, the Zone Improvement Plan divided the country into ten regions and assigned 5 digits increasing in specificity, from region to large sorting centers. 
              The two first digits associated with city of Chicago zip code are 60. The 3 last are specifics to post office or delivery area. For data analysis purpose, ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) are often used instead of postal zip codes. These are approximate area representations of U.S. Postal Service (USPS) ZIP Code service areas that the Census Bureau creates to present statistical data from Census.
              </p>
            <p>
              ZIP codes division can be helpful for visualizing spatial inequalities in Chicago. 
              As each zip code have a different number of facilities, one need to remove this bias. To do so, we will normalize the facilities count as follows: 
              definition of proportion: #facilities with feature (i) per zip code / #total facilities per zip code.

                    More than 80% facilities that were inspected due to suspected food poisoning are associated with a high risk level.  
                    Also, almost none of them are associated with a low risk level which shows the consistency of this risk scale.

                In order to investigate about the link between the risk level and foodborne illness, we decided to visualize the relationship between the proportion of facilities associated with a high risk level and the proportion of food poisoning within a zip code.

                Curiously, even if the area associated with the zip code 60827 (marked in the plot) have the lowest proportion of high risk facilities, a high number of inspections due to food poisoning can be observed.
                The 60827 zip code is associated with a community called Riverdale. Riverdale is one of the hardest neighborhoods in the city and considered one of the most dangerous communities.
                It is known to struggle with high unemployment, poverty and gang violence.
                </p>
              <p>
                The Chicago Community Area of Riverdale includes Altgeld Gardens, a public housing development once dubbed Chicago's <span style="color: maroon;"><b><i>toxic doughnut</i></b></span> due to having the highest concentration of hazardous waste sites in the nation (<a href = "https://ejatlas.org/conflict/chicagos-toxic-doughnut-usa"><i>source</i></a>). 
                Therefore, the high number of inspection due to food poisoning reported in this area could be explained by the fact that this factor contributed to health burdens in the community through water contamination. 
                In fact, water contamination leads to a poor cleanliness (contaminated cooking tools, food..) which may increase the poisoning cases even though the facility have safe food preparation habits. 
                Thus, Riverdale could be considered as an outlier.
                After removing this outlier, a Spearman's correlation was run to determine the relationship between the proportion of facilities associated with a high risk level and the proportion of inspection due to food poisoning. 
                There was a weak, positive monotonic correlation between these two parameters reflectexted by a significant coefficient equal to 0.4 (n = 51, p < 0.05).

                Each violation have a number which refers to a particular category. The Chicago Food Reporting Inspection System distinguish between 3 type of violations.

              The correlation between the food poisoning frequency within a zip code and the distance from the city center is a moderate, negative monotonic correlation reflected by significant coefficient equal to -0.44 (n = 51, p < 0.05). 
              The correlation between the food poisoning frequency within a zip code and the distance from the sea  is also a moderate, negative monotonic correlation reflected by significant coefficient equal to -0.53 (n = 51, p < 0.001).
            </p>
            <p>
              Looking at the plot above, we can conclude that the further the distance from the sea, the less food poisoning cases are encountered.

              What could explain these observations?

            <p>
              <span style="color:rgb(63, 126, 155)"><b>Escherichia coli</b></span> is a bacterium that lives in the intestines of humans and animals alike and also causes food poisoning illness. A major source of E. coli infections is undercooked beef. Other sources of E. coli bacteria include <span style="color: rgb(63, 126, 155)"><b>drinking or swimming in water that is contaminated by sewage. 
              E. coli bacterium</b></span>, which is present in stool, can be passed from person-to-person as a result of improper hygiene or handwashing practices.
              People can become infected when a contaminated city or town water supply has not been properly treated with chlorine or when people accidentally swallow contaminated water while swimming in a lake, beach, or irrigation canal.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Chicago Park District issued swim advisories at beaches along Chicago's Lake Michigan lakefront based on E. coli levels. The US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) recommends notifying the public when E. coli bacteria levels are above the federal water quality Beach Action Value (BAV), which is 235*CFU.
              Using <a href= "https://www.kaggle.com/chicago/chicago-beach-swim,-weather,-lab-data" style="color:white"><u>data</u></a> showing predicted E. coli levels in Chicago beaches water based on an experimental analytical modeling approach, we can try to detect if some beaches are 
              particularly contaminated.

              <p style = 'text-align: center'><i>Poison concentration with markers for e-coli levels in the seawater. Red: the e-coli concentration exceeds more than 30 times the BAV,
                Orange: the e-coli concentration exceeds more then 11 times the BAV,
                Blue: the e-coli concentration exceeds at most 11 times the BAV.

              <p>
                In general, a high e-coli predicted concentration (more than 11 times above the BAV) seems to correlate with a high proportion of food poisoning (> 4%), as it can be seen in the following zip codes: 60660, 60640, 60611, 60605, 60616. 
                On the other hand, a relative low e-coli predicted concentration (less than 11 times above the BAV) seems to be correlated with a low proportion of food poisoning (< 4%) as observed in the zip code 60653 and 60626. 
                However, even if they have green spots, the zip codes 60614, 60610 and 60637 have proportion of food poisoning higher than 4%.  This could be explained by the fact that the zip codes 60614 and 60610 have a high number of facilities associated with a high risk (more than 83%). The zip code 60637 have a moderate number of facilities associated with a high risk, thus it seems to be an exception.
              </p>
              <p>
                A possible cause of such a correlation (e-coli and food poisoning cases) could be that when people swim at the beach, they could drink water contaminated with e-coli and develop the same symptom as the ones for a food born illness. They could also swim and then go to a food facility and contaminate the environment increasing the risk of the bacteria propagation within the restaurant, grocery ..

                  In order to have a better insight into food poisoning in Chicago, we decided to analyze real consumers’ complaints. 
                  Patrick Quade, who had no history with the restauration or science world when he started the <a href= "https://iwaspoisoned.com/page/about"><u>IWasPoisoned</u></a> website, was working in finance in New York City when he says the facility that sold him bad food ignored his complaints. Furious, he created an online platform to report food poisoning. People self-report suspected foodborne illnesses after dining in a specific facility. 
                  Details are given on the time and date, the food ordered, and even the symptoms of the experienced sickness. This way, the website has a track record of accurately spotting illness outbreaks even before health officials or restaurants. In 2017, information gathered from his users helped identify the norovirus outbreak at Chipotle restaurants (<a href = "https://www.livescience.com/59885-chipotle-outbreak-norovirus.html"><i>Source: Livescience</i></a>).

                  <p>Using approximately 200 posts from the website <a href = "https://iwaspoisoned.com/page/about"><u>IWasPoisoned</u></a> we constructed a word cloud to represent the most frequent words.</p>
                  <p> 
                    We can notice that words describing frequent symptoms of food borne illness such as ‘diarrhea’, ‘fever and ‘vomit’ are highly present in the complaints. 
                    Some words also give insight on the types of food ingested before the illness. 
                    As seen in the <a href="#foodpie"><u>pie chart</u></a> above, food poisoning is commonly caused by undercooked chicken .

                  <br>
                  Since the proximity to the sea is suspected to play a role in food poisoning due to Ecoli infections, we plot the frequency of the words from these categories with respect to the distance to the sea.

                  We trained and tested a couple of machine learning models to predict the inspections due to food poisoning cases. We believe that this could be an efficient way to identify restaurants that might promote the spread of food-borne illness with high risk of poisoning for the population. 
                  This will alert Chicago health care department about these restaurants, and encourage them to act accordingly, by re-inspecting the facility for instance. The features will mainly include: The list of violations committed during the inspection, the location (zip code), the risk factor of the restaurant, and the result.

                      After running two different  binary classification models, we were able to reach an accuracy of more than 99%. 
                      However, a further analysis revealed that the class is extremely unbalanced, with the negative value corresponding to over 99% of the data. 
                      Furthermore, we discovered that the model is completely unefficient at predicting food poisoning cases, and maximizes the accuracy by classifying each of the inspections as non-related to food poisoning.

                    We also made use of a score that we created based on the <a href="#bubble"><u> violations frequency</u></a> during food poisoning inspections. The more frequent a violation is, the bigger the associated weight.

                  We could identify way more accurately cases related to Food Poisoning (True Positives), and we concluded that the second model is more suited for classifying correctly these rare cases. 
                  This however involves a fairly large loss of overall accuracy and the model tend to classify more frequently cases of non-food poisoning as such.

                  In a nutshell, by studying the data set from the food inspections with care, we have found various related factors and attempted to predict which restaurants will cause food poisoning. 
                  The results were not convincing enough to insure the precision of these predictions. 
                  However, thanks to various platforms on the internet, it is still possible to avoid people from being sick !

                <p>
                  <b>Here is a guideline that could be helpful for a consumer in Chicago:</b>
                  <ul>
                  <li>Do not trust the inspection results of the facility. A facility that passed the inspection might still cause food poisoning.</li>
                  <li>Be careful when ordering meat dishes. Various sickness arise from uncooked meat such as chicken.</li>
                  <li>Report any food poisoning on online platforms such as iwaspoisoned.com. It may discourage other people from going to the same restaurant.</li>
                  <li>Report food poisoning to the health officials to avoid an outbreak.</li>

                  <b>Guidelines for a food business:</b>
                  <br>Give extra care to the hygienic measures and cooking methods. Be more pre-cautious if:
                  <ul>
                    <li>The risk of your facility is high.</li>
