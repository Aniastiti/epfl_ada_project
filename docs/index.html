                Food poisoning, also called foodborne illness, is an infection or irritation of your digestive tract that spreads through food or drinks. 
                Viruses, bacteria, and parasites cause most food poisoning. 
                Harmful chemicals may also be a contributor (<a href = "https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/digestive-diseases/food-poisoning/definition-facts"> <i> source: NIH </i></a>).
                Food poisoning was first identified as a public health issue in the 1880s.

              Chicago is home to more than 20,000 food establishments like restaurants, grocery stores, bakeries, and more. In order to prevent the spread of food-borne disease, inspections are periodically performed by a team from the Chicago Department of Public Health’s Food Protection Program (<a href = "https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/ofinterest/bus/food.html)" style="color:white"><i>Source: Chicago Goverment</i></a>).
              </p>
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>2 main types of inspections were considered: Routine Health Inspections (canvas) and Complaint- Based Health Inspections (complaints and inspections due to food poisoning).</li>
                <li>The frequency of these inspections is based on the risk level assigned to the establishment. This risk depends on the types of food prepared and the methods used for preparing and serving the food. In general, risk 1 establishments are inspected twice per year, risk 2 establishments once per year, and risk 3 establishments every other year.</li>
                <li>An inspection can pass, pass with conditions or fail (<a href = "https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/depts/cdph/provdrs/healthy_restaurants/svcs/understand_healthcoderequirementsforfoodestablishments.html" style = "color:white"><i>source: Chicago Government</i></a>).

              Between 1940 and 1960, the amount of mail doubled in The United States . In 1963, the Zone Improvement Plan divided the country into ten regions and assigned 5 digits increasing in specificity, from region to large sorting centers. 
              The two first digits associated with city of Chicago zip code are 60. The 3 last are specifics to post office or delivery area. For data analysis purpose, ZIP Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTAs) are often used instead of postal zip codes. These are approximate area representations of U.S. Postal Service (USPS) ZIP Code service areas that the Census Bureau creates to present statistical data from Census.
              </p>
            <p>
              ZIP codes division can be helpful for visualizing spatial inequalities in Chicago. 
              As each zip code have a different number of facilities, one need to remove this bias. To do so, we will normalize the facilities count as follows: 
              definition of proportion: #facilities with feature (i) per zip code / #total facilities per zip code.
              <br>An example of this is shown below with the fail proportion of the facilites per zip code for the food inspections.

                  developed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have been adopted by many states with regards to inspection practices and report forms.
                  Many jurisdictions now make inspection results available online, allowing consumers to view the results when considering where to dine. But the usefulness of this information to reduce the risk of foodborne illness is still unknown.

                  This factor is reflected by the <span style="color: maroon; top:0; padding: 0"><b>risk level attributed to each facility.</b></span>
                    More than 80% facilities that were inspected due to suspected food poisoning are associated with a high risk level.  
                    Also, almost none of them are associated with a low risk level which shows the consistency of this risk scale.
                    <br>
                    Although the plot show that over 80% of the facilities that are suspected for food poisoning have a high risk level, we can not conclude that a facility with a high risk level will cause food poisoning.

                Curiously, even if the area associated with the zip code 60827 (marked in the plot) have the lowest proportion of high risk facilities, a high number of inspections due to food poisoning can be observed.
                The 60827 zip code is associated with a community called Riverdale. Riverdale is one of the hardest neighborhoods in the city and considered one of the most dangerous communities.
                It is known to struggle with high unemployment, poverty and gang violence.
                </p>
              <p>
                The Chicago Community Area of Riverdale includes Altgeld Gardens, a public housing development once dubbed Chicago's "toxic doughnut"  due to having the highest concentration of hazardous waste sites in the nation (<a href = "https://ejatlas.org/conflict/chicagos-toxic-doughnut-usa"><i>source</i></a>).
                This factor contributed to health burdens in the community through water contamination and air pollution. 
                Thus, the high number of inspection due to food poisoning reported in this area could be explained by the fact that this factor contributed to health burdens in the community through water contamination. 
                In fact, water contamination leads to a poor cleanliness (contaminated cooking tools, food..) which may increase the poisoning cases even though the facility have safe food preparation habits. 
                Thus, Riverdale could be considered as an outlier.
                After removing this outlier, a Spearman's correlation was run to determine the relationship between the proportion of facilities associated with a high risk level and the proportion of inspection due to food poisoning. 
                There was a weak, positive monotonic correlation between these two parameters reflectexted by a significant coefficient equal to 0.4 (n = 51, p < 0.05).
                </p>
              <p>
                Each violation have a number which refers to a particular category of violations. The Chicago Food Reporting Inspection System distinguish between 3 type of violations. 
                <ul>
                <li>From 1 to 14 : Priority (P) Violations, which are critical can create an immediate health hazard that carries a greater risk of causing food-borne illness. The facility needs to correct immediately this kind of violation during the inspection otherwise the license business is suspended.</li> 
                <li>From 15 to 29 : Priority Foundation (FP) Violation, which are serious can create a potential health hazard. If not immediately corrected , the inspection fails.</li>
                <li>From 30 to 44 + 70 : Core Violation (C), which are minor do not pose an immediate threat to the public’s health.</li>
                </ul>
                
                The inspections that were made due to suspected poisoning shows a higher frequency of priority and priority foundation violations.

              The correlation between the food poisoning frequency within a zip code and the distance by the city center is a moderate, negative monotonic correlation reflected by significant coefficient equal to -0.44 (n = 51, p < 0.05). 
              The correlation between the food poisoning frequency within a zip code and the distance by the sea  is also a moderate, negative monotonic correlation reflected by significant coefficient equal to -0.53 (n = 51, p < 0.001).

              What could explain these observations?

            <p>
              <span style="color:rgb(63, 126, 155)"><b>Escherichia coli</b></span> is a bacterium that lives in the intestines of humans and animals alike and also causes food poisoning illness. A major source of E. coli infections is undercooked beef. Other sources of E. coli bacteria include <span style="color: rgb(63, 126, 155)"><b>drinking or swimming in water that is contaminated by sewage. 
              E. coli bacterium</b></span>, which is present in stool, can be passed from person-to-person as a result of improper hygiene or handwashing practices.
              People can become infected when a contaminated city or town water supply has not been properly treated with chlorine or when people accidentally swallow contaminated water while swimming in a lake, beach, or irrigation canal.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Chicago Park District issued swim advisories at beaches along Chicago's Lake Michigan lakefront based on E. coli levels. The US Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) recommends notifying the public when E. coli bacteria levels are above the federal water quality Beach Action Value (BAV), which is 235*CFU.
              Using <a href= "https://www.kaggle.com/chicago/chicago-beach-swim,-weather,-lab-data" style="color:white"><u>data</u></a> showing predicted E. coli levels in Chicago beaches water based on an experimental analytical modeling approach, we can try to detect if some beaches are 
              particularly contaminated.

              <p>
                In general, a high e-coli predicted concentration (more than 11 times above the BAV) seems to correlate with a high proportion of food poisoning (> 4%), as it can be seen in the following zip codes: 60660, 60640, 60611, 60605, 60616. 
                On the other hand, a relative low e-coli predicted concentration (less than 11 times above the BAV) seems to be correlated with a low proportion of food poisoning (< 4%) as observed in the zip code 60653 and 60626. 
                However, even if they have green spots, the zip codes 60614, 60610 and 60637 have proportion of food poisoning higher than 4%.  This could be explained by the fact that the zip codes 60614 and 60610 have a high number of facilities associated with a high risk (more than 83%). The zip code 60637 have a moderate number of facilities associated with a high risk, thus it seems to be an exception.

                  In order to have a better insight into food poisoning in Chicago, we decided to analyze real consumers’ complaints. 
                  Patrick Quade, who had no history with the restauration or science world when he started the <a href= "https://iwaspoisoned.com/page/about"><u>IWasPoisoned</u></a> website, was working in finance in New York City when he says the facility that sold him bad food ignored his complaints. Furious, he created an online platform to report food poisoning. People self-report suspected foodborne illnesses after dining in a specific facility. 
                  Details are given on the time and date, the food ordered, and even the symptoms of the experienced sickness. This way, the website has a track record of accurately spotting illness outbreaks even before health officials or restaurants. In 2017, information gathered from his users helped identify the norovirus outbreak at Chipotle restaurants (<a href = "https://www.livescience.com/59885-chipotle-outbreak-norovirus.html"><i>Source: Livescience</i></a>).
                </p>
                <h3>Reports of violations</h3>
                <p>
                  There are many reports that contain the violation numbers that is found in the food inspesction data.
                  The priority violations 3 (problem in hot and cold storage temperature) is reported more than 50 times. This violation is more frequent in food poisoning cases as seen <a href="#bubble"><u>here</u></a>. The violation 5, which is also frequently reported, correspond to reserved food. ( modifiy this when we will have the final plot )

                    The word cloud plot shows the most frequent words used by people who have reported food poisoning on <a href = "https://iwaspoisoned.com/page/about"><u>IWasPoisoned</u></a>. 
                    We can notice that words describing frequent symptoms of food borne illness such as ‘diarrhea’, ‘fever and ‘vomit’ are highly present in the complaints. 
                    Some words also give insight on the types of food ingested before the illness. 
                    As seen in the <a href="#foodpie"><u>pie chart</u></a> above, food poisoning is commonly caused by undercooked chicken .

                  Thanks to the lexicon, the words will be distributed into 2 categories: <b>Symptoms</b> and <b>Food</b>.
                  <br>
                  Since the proximity to the sea is suspected to play a role in food poisoning due to Ecoli infections, we plot the frequency of the words from these categories with respect to the distance to the sea.
